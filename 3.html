    <h3>JavaScript이란 무엇인가?</h3>
    <p>
        JavaScript (JS)[a] is a programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995.[6] Ninety-nine percent of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.[10]

        Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.[11]

        JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time–compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[12] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM)
